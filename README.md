# Starbucks Nutritional Dataset Anaylsis
## Roselle Deinla, Amanda Tormey, Andrea Ngyuen

This project is meant to be a hands-on approch with the statistical testing and methods discussed in our second-year Data Science course, DATA2010 - Tools and Techniques for Data Science (Completed Winter 2023). The main language of this project is R.

The content of interest is the '[Starbucks drinks](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2021/2021-12-21/starbucks.csv)' dataset from tidytuesdayR, which provides nutritional information on 93 unique Starbucks drinks.

The main drive of our analysis is to infer if calories, total fat, and sugar content have significant impacts among one another, due to these quantities being the most relevant to consumers.
In addition, it would be interesting to test their combined influence on nutrition content from drink to drink.

Our following hypothesis tests and models aim to derive the impact that these quantities have on one another, confirm/debunk prior domain knowledge and justify our reasoning on certain assumptions.

We have also decided to implement both Regression and Classification models on our dataset.
