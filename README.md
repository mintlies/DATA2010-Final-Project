This project is meant to be a hands-on approch with the machine learning topics and models discussed in our second-year Data Science course, DATA2010 - Tools and Techniques for Data Science (Completed Winter 2023).

Working with the '[Predict student's dropout and academic success]()' dataset from, it is comprised of information collected on graduate, dropout and currently enrolled students of an unnamed post-secondary institution.

The goal of this project is to produce the two most accurate possible models that can predict whether a student will graduate or dropout of their studies. We have trained four different binary classification models utilizing sklearn, and took into account different scores to determine the best contenders.
